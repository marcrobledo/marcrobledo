## Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Marc
Software, web and videogames developer. I started coding on my own when I was a child and, since then, I've been progressing onto new languages and technologies. I'm always up to discover new coding and design possibilities.

**Some of my apps:**
- [Rom Patcher JS](https://www.marcrobledo.com/RomPatcher.js/)
- [BOTW Save Editor] (https://www.marcrobledo.com/savegame-editors/zelda-botw/)
- [Super Game Boy Border Injector](https://www.marcrobledo.com/super-game-boy-border-injector/)
- More apps in my [Portfolio](https://www.marcrobledo.com/)

I'm also very focused on retro console videogame reverse engineering, skilled in ROM Hacking and, particularly, translations and Game Boy Colorizations.

**My videogame translations and remasterizations:**
- [Mega Man World 5 DX](https://www.marcrobledo.com/game-boy/mega-man-world-5-dx/)
- [Samurai Kid English Translation](https://www.marcrobledo.com/game-boy/samurai-kid-english-translation/)
- [Mobile Golf English Translation](https://www.marcrobledo.com/game-boy/mobile-golf-english-translation/)
